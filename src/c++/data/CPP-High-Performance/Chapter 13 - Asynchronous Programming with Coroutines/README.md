# C++ High Performance (2nd Edition)

## Highlights from Chapter 13 - "Asynchronous Programming with Coroutines"

### Awaitable types (revisited)
These were touched on briefly [earlier](../Chapter%2012%20-%20Coroutines%20and%20Lazy%20Generators/README.md#keywords), but here we expand on the topic in a little more detail.

[co_await.cpp](co_await.cpp)

#
### Implicit suspend points
Each coroutine has two implicit suspend points:
* The __*initial suspend point*__, and
* The __*final suspend point*__

The promise type defines the behaviour of these two points, and it is typical to pass `std::suspend_always()` from the initial suspend.

#
### Implementing a rudimentary `Task` type
The aim is to write asynchronous code like this:
```cpp
auto image = co_await load("image.jpg");
auto thumbnail = co_await resize(image, 100, 100);
co_await save(thumbnail, "thumbnail.jpg");
```
In other words, "we want to plaster co_await everywhere like we do with auto".

`std::future` blocks threads when retrieving values, so it does not support continuations (pg. 443), although apparently `std::experimental::future` does (which `experimental` across compilers, who knows). It also creates allocations on the heap and include synchronisation primities, so we're better off creating our own type.

The code is on the author's [GitHub](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Cpp-High-Performance-Second-Edition/blob/master/Chapter13/task.h) if you're interested - similar to other examples given in previous chapters, the example from the book at this stage is incomplete, so (whilst it might be a nice exercise in typing out the code) not being able to visualise and tweak a finished product is irritating (I promise I'll say nice things eventually!).

#

### Handling errors
We can use a `std::variant` within the `Promise` class to handle the three possible outcomes:
* No value at all - `std::monostate`
* A return value of type `T` - `T`
* An exception - `std::exception_ptr`

```cpp
std::variant<std::monostate, T, std::exception_ptr> result_;
```
>_"The exception is captured by using the std::current_exception() function inside the function Promise::unhandled_exception()."_<br>
> _"By storing a std::exception_ptr, we can later rethrow this exception in another context."_<br>
> _"This is also the mechanism used when exceptions are passed between threads."_<br>
> – pg. 445

__*NB:*__ Implementing a promise type that contains both `return_void()` and `return_value()` generates a compilation error.

#
### Symmetric transfer
We can use a technique called __*symmetric transfer*__ to avoid creating nested stack frames during continuation.
```cpp
auto await_suspend(std::experimental::coroutine_handle<Promise> h) noexcept
{   // symmetric transfer
    return h.promise().continuation_;
}
```
> _"An optimization called tail call optimization is then guaranteed to happen by the compiler."_<br>
> "_In our case, this means that the compiler will be able to transfer control directly to the continuation without creating a new nested call frame."_ – pg. 448

#
### Synchronously waiting for a task to complete
> _"Once we call an asynchronous function that returns a Task, we need to co_await on it, or nothing will happen._"<br>
> _"This is also the reason why we declare Task to be nodiscard: so that it generates a compilation warning if the return value is ignored, like this:"_ – pg. 450

#
### Implementing `sync_await()`
Another function from [cppcoro](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro#sync_wait) that is jsut copy-pasta with no "this is why you want to use this feature / look at the improvement!".

> _"Destroying a coroutine must only happen if the coroutine is in a suspended state."_ – pg. 454

#
### The end result...
```cpp
Task<int> height() { co_return 20; }
Task<int>  width() { co_return 30; }
Task<int>   area()
{
  co_return co_await height() * co_await width();
}

int main()
{ // Dummy coroutines
  Task<int> a = area();
  int value = sync_wait(a);
  std::cout << value;
}
```
Three pages of boilerplate...to calculate an area...

#
### `boost::asio`
Just because recruiters want to see use of boost.

[boost_asio.cpp](boost_asio.cpp)

#
### Wrapping a callback-based API
Yet more boilerplate to print ["hello"](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Cpp-High-Performance-Second-Edition/blob/master/Chapter13/asio_timer_coro.cpp)...

#
### `boost::asio` TCP Server
An implementation of a TCP Server using `boost::asio` – `boost::asio` seems to be mentioned a lot when it comes to sockets, so this will probably be worth making a note of.

[boost_server.cpp](boost_server.cpp)

This was actually a really interesting exercise.

Once we have the programme up and running (listening), we can use a telnet-style programme to attempt to make a connection through hte port of our choice – on macOS, I used netcat across multiple terminal instances, issuing the following command:
```bash
nc localhost 37259
```
Xcode allowed me to see all inbound / outbound connections, as well as packets sent, but what was most interesting was the sheer amount of energy and CPU power taken up by this simple programme without a `break` statement in the catch-all.

Energy and CPU draw would be fine in the beginning, but would __*sky-rocket*__ the moment the client disconnected from the server!

With one client disconnected, CPU usage would leap from 0% to over 50%, then 67% for 2 client disconnections, etc etc, all using high to very high energy usage - this is a big issue if left unaddressed.

Including a `break` (or even a `co_return`) brings (and keeps) CPU usage / energy draw back down to 0% throughout, regardless of how many connections were open and closed.

This is a simple, yet critical, section of the code.

It is possible to use threads to serve multiple sessions concurrently, but _"the memory overhead if threads would set the limit ofnthe number of sessions substantially lower compared to this model using coroutines."_ – pg. 463

Using the same thread means we do not need to lock shared resources.

#
### Noteworthy quotations
> _"Creating detached tasks using `boost::asio::co_spawn()`, ..., should be done with the utmost of caution."_<br>
> _"A fairly new programming paradigm for avoiding detached work is called __*structured concurrency*__."_<br>
> _"The key idea is to never allow some a child task to exceed the lifetime of its parent."_<br>
> _"This makes it possible to pass local variables by reference to asynchronous child operations safely and with better performance"_ – pg. 463

> _"Another important aspect is that asynchronous tasks should always be lazy (immediately suspended), so that continuations can be attached before any exceptions can be thrown."_<br>
> _"This is also a requirement if you want to be able to cancel a task in a safe manner"_ – pg. 464

#
### Summary
Bar the last example from `boost::asio`, this has (unfortunately) been my least favourite chapter of all.

It feels like an extension of Chapter 12, only with more boilerplate, and the glorified "area" and "hello, world" examples were very disappointing.

The whole premise of this book is "high performance" - I hate to sound scathing or flippant, but where is the performance?

Let's see what the next chapter has in store.
