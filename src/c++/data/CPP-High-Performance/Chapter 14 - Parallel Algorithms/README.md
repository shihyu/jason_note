# C++ High Performance (2nd Edition)

## Highlights from Chapter 14 - "Parallel Algorithms"

### Evaluating parallel algorithms
To calculate speedup, we can use the following formula:

$$ Speedup = { {T}_ {1} \over {T}_ {n} } $$

To calculate the efficiency of a parallel algorithm, we can use a variation of the formula above:

$$ Efficiency = { {T}_ {1} \over {T}_ {n} * n } $$

To calculate the __*maximum*__ speedup of a parallel algorithm, we can use a modified version of _"Amdahl's Law"_

$$ Maximum\text{ }speedup = { 1 \over { {F}_ {par} \over n } + (1 - {F}_ {par} ) } $$

...where ${F}_ {par}$ is the fraction of the programme that can be executed in parallel.

Better examples of how to calculate ${F}_ {par}$ for a function would have gone down well.

#
### Implementing parallel `std::transform()`
Here is the original implementation from Apple Clang:
```cpp
template <class _InputIt, class _OutputIt, class _UnaryOperation>
_OutputIt transform(_InputIt __first, _InputIt __last, _OutputIt __result, _UnaryOperation __op) {
    for (; __first != __last; ++__first, (void) ++__result)
        *__result = __op(*__first);
    return __result;
}
```

#
### More Google Benchmark (finally!)
Some interesting new techniques like `MeasureProcessCPUTime()` and `UseRealTime()` with a custom arguments functions to help reduce repitition in the code - like it!
```cpp
void CustomArguments(benchmark::internal::Benchmark* b) {
    b->Arg(50)->Arg(10'000)->Arg(1'000'000) // Input size
    ->MeasureProcessCPUTime()               // Measure all threads
    ->UseRealTime()                         // Clock on the wall
    ->Unit(benchmark::kMillisecond);        // Use ms
}
```
Slightly off-topic, but I may also eat my own words from previous chapters, as Apple have just released Xcode 14.3 Beta 1 with loads of new C++ support, including `std::ranges` and `std::views` and elements from C++23.

In terms of the benchmark itself, just like the author I experienced similar if not slightly worse results using a parallel algorithm with 50 elements compared to the sequential run. The run at 10,000 elements, however, was nearly 8x faster, and at 1,000,000 elements was over 9x faster, so certainly worth it if you're dealing with a lot of elements.

1) $speedup = { 0.083 \over 0.088 } = 0.94,\text{ }efficiency = { 0.083 \over 0.088 * 12 } = 0.0785$ (50 elements)
2) $speedup = { 16.4 \over 2.15 }\text{ }= 7.63,\text{ }efficiency = { 16.3 \over 2.15 * 12 }\text{ }\text{ }= 0.636$ (10,000 elements)
3) $speedup = { 1651 \over 170 }\text{ }= 9.71,\text{ }efficiency = { 1651 \over 170 * 12 }\text{ }\text{ }= 0.809$ (1,000,000 elements)

[parallel_benchmark.cpp](parallel_benchmark.cpp)

One of the pitfalls for this implementation is that it would only scale well if all chunk sizes were the same - in real life, though, this is apparently rarely the case.

#
### Divide and Conquer
An interesting name for a sub-chapter - you would frequently see divide and conquer employed in recurise functions like merge sort, which recursively (and logarithmically in this case) _divides_ itself into base cases, _conquers_ said base cases then _combines_ the sub-tasks into one final solution.

Other examples of _Divide and Conquer_ algorithms would be the likes of:
* Substitution method
* [Recusion-tree and "Master" methods](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/lectures/lec20-master/lec20.html)
* [Akra-Bazzi method](https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Akra_Bazzi/document.pdf)

[divide_and_conquer.cpp](divide_and_conquer.cpp) | [divide_and_benchmark.cpp](divide_and_benchmark.cpp)

It's a shame GitHub doesn't have good barchart markdown - would have been nice to convert the results in the benchmark into something visual (here's a link to [quick-bench](https://quick-bench.com/q/V_Nf8u0ZOIIs2y_LfGjebjCMwQQ) anyway).

#
### Applying divide and conquer to `std::count_if`
A similar logarithmic pattern here with `std::count_if`, this time named `par::count_if` (thought it might be cleaner to give the parallel functions their own namepsace with a similar function name instead of a longer function name) – I'll have to construct a benchmark of how both compare in terms of performance.

The chunk-calculating helper function is a nice abstraction, allowing you to either specify the chunk size manually or allow the hardware to decide.

[divide_and_count_if.cpp](divide_and_count_if.cpp)

#
### Applying parallelism to `std::copy_if`
Below is how `std::copy_if` is written in the standard library.
```cpp
template <typename _InputIt, typename _OutputIt, typename _Predicate>
_OutputIt copy_if(_InputIt __first, _InputIt __last, _OutputIt __result, _Predicate __pred) {
    for (; __first != __last; ++__first) {
        if (__pred(*__first)) {
            *__result = *__first;
            ++__result;
        }
    } return __result;
}
```
Tweaking this algorithm to run in parallel is slightly more difficult than the last two, as this time we have we have a mutable iterator that needs to work concurrently.

[par_copy_if.cpp](par_copy_if.cpp)

We can split the algorithm into two seperate parts - one part copying, the other part moving.

[par_copy_n_move.cpp](par_copy_n_move.cpp)

This version of the `copy_if` algorithm performs a lot better in benchmarks compared to the other one for the following reason:

> _" it is because the cache mechanism of the hardware is trashed due to several threads writing to the same cache line"_ – pg. 486

Based on this statement (and the reference to Chapter 7), maybe we could find a way to align our chunks in such a way that the same cache line isn't thrahed like in the example (maybe that would be an interesting exercise at some point).

#
### Parallel standard library algorithms
As of C++17, we can get an istant performance boost with STL algorithms by using execution policies e.g.
```cpp
std::sort(std::execution::par, ivec.begin(), ivec.end());
```
* std::execution::par (par for parallel)
* std::execution::seq (the normal sequantial policy)
* std::execution::unseq (allow the algorithm to be vectorised)
* std::execution::par_unseq (allow the vector to be vectorised __*and*__ parallel)

There are three things to bear in mind with execution policies:
1) Iterators are forward iterators
2) Exceptions thrown cannot be reached - instead `std::terminate` is called.
3) Time complexity guarantees are also more relaxed

With all parallel work, you must ensure your code is thread-safe e.g. do not use mutable references in a lambda capture list, or you run hte risk of a data race - use `std::transform_reduce` or `std::reduce` instead:
```cpp
❌: std::for_each(std::execution::par, svec.begin(), svec.end() [&] (const std::string &str) { counter += str.size(); } );
✅: std::reduce(std::execution::par, svec.begin(), svec.end() [] (std::size_t local_counter, const std::string &str) { local_counter += str.size(); } );
```

We could also use `std::atomic` or `std::mutex`, but this would degrade efficiency.

You cannot use synchronisation primitives with std::execution::unseq, as this will run the risk of creating deadlocks.

[Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-standard-c-with-gpus-using-stdpar/) take advantage of execution policies in their in-house compiler, `nvc++`.

#
### `std::accumulate` and `std::reduce`
Where operations are commutative (think ["group theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property)), we can use `std::reduce` in place of `std::accumulate` to achieve faster results.
```cpp
❌: std::accumulate(ivec.begin(), ivec.end(), 0);
✅: std::reduce(ivec.begin(), ivec.end(), 0);
```
This will not work in situations where you might be sorting a string as `abc` += `cba`:
```cpp
✅: std::accumulate(svec.begin(), svec.end(), std::string());
❌: std::reduce(svec.begin(), svec.end(), std::string());
```

#
### `std::transform_reduce`
A nice example of `std::transform_reduce` to calculate the cumulative number of chars is a vector of strings:
```cpp
std::vector<std::string> svec = { "man", "bear", "pig" };
    
    std::size_t num_chars = std::transform_reduce(svec.begin(), svec.end(), 0,
                                                  [] (std::size_t a, std::size_t b) { return a + b; },  // reduce
                                                  [] (const std::string &str) { return str.size(); } ); // transform
```
For a few elements, [`std::transform` is 1.2x faster than `std::accumulate`](https://quick-bench.com/q/pM19yT8oecHCUISfgL_01tzRKY0) – it would be interesting to see how much of a different a much larger vector of strings would have on runtime.

#
### `std::for_each`
`std::for_each` returns the function object passed to it - this can be useful for accumulating values inside a stateful function object.

The parallel version of `std::for_each` returns `void`.

There are some other bits on using `std::views::iota` to create a hard-coded parallel `for` loop, but I'll pass.

#
### Coding for GPU's
The workflow is as follows:
* CPU allocates memory on the GPU
* Data is copied from main memory to GPU memory
* CPU launches a kernel on the GPU
* Data is copied back to the CPU

Execution polocies `std::execution::par` and `std::execution::par_unseq` allow compilers to move the execution of standard algorithms from the CPU to the GPU

This was a stupid end to the chapter, dangling the carrot to how to write an algorithm that can be executed on a GPU, but it was just blurb and links.

#
### Summary

> _"I will keep updating the GitHub repository and adding information about compiler support"_

The only updates on the GitHub repo have been price updates for the eBook- no issues have been addressed in the last three since publishing.

Despite this, this has definitely been one of the better chapters. Again, like many other features, execution policies aren't widely-accepted, but learning the divide and conquer technique across both immutable __and__ mutable containers is invaluable, the Google Benchmark techniques used were very useful, and learning `std::reduce` / `std::reduce_transform` will now doubt be a very useful tool in the toolbox.

I'm glad the book ended on a high note, as I was really started to lose interest.

I'd give it a 5/10 - with better examples, the material would have been both much more applicable, as well as much more memorable. This combined with the overly-C++20 style of writing and poor use of whitespace probably made this book harder to follow at times than it needed to be.

I hope the author continues to write though, and perhaps introduces another performance-oriented book.
