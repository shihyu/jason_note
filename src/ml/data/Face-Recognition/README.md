# Face-Recognition
This repository contains a comprehensive face recognition system that combines YOLOv8 for face detection and FaceNet for face recognition. Face recognition is a critical technology with applications in security, surveillance, and user authentication. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to achieve accurate and reliable face recognition.

- Detect faces in images using YOLO.
- Crop and save the detected faces.
- Recognize faces using DeepFace and categorize them based on a pre-trained model.
- Do whatever you feel like from the features extracted.

## Demo
Experience the functionality of our face recognition model, which has been trained on a dataset featuring faces of few politicians, by visiting [Live Demo](https://face-recognition-ml.streamlit.app/). Please keep in mind that this deployment is specifically designed for demonstration purposes and may not be fine-tuned for optimal performance in real-world scenarios. The best place to start and learn about the project's evolution is the ["o-testing"](https://github.com/sOR-o/Face-Recognition/tree/main/o-testing) folder. Here, you'll find different levels of understanding, providing comprehensive insights into the project's development.
