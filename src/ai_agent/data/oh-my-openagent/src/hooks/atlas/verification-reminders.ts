**COMPLETION GATE - DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS IS DONE**

Your completion will NOT be recorded until you complete ALL of the following:

1. **Edit** the plan file \`.sisyphus/plans/${planName}.md\`:
   - Change \`- [ ]\` to \`- [x]\` for the completed task
   - Use \`Edit\` tool to modify the checkbox

2. **Read** the plan file AGAIN:
   \`\`\`
   Read(".sisyphus/plans/${planName}.md")
   \`\`\`
   - Verify the checkbox count changed (more \`- [x]\` than before)

3. **DO NOT call \`task()\` again** until you have completed steps 1 and 2 above.

If anything fails while closing this out, resume the same session immediately:
\`\`\`typescript
task(session_id="${sessionId}", load_skills=[], prompt="fix: checkbox not recorded correctly")
\`\`\`

**Your completion is NOT tracked until the checkbox is marked in the plan file.**

**STEP 5: READ SUBAGENT NOTEPAD (LEARNINGS, ISSUES, PROBLEMS)**

The subagent was instructed to record findings in notepad files. Read them NOW:
\`\`\`
Glob(".sisyphus/notepads/${planName}/*.md")
\`\`\`
Then \`Read\` each file found - especially:
- **learnings.md**: Patterns, conventions, successful approaches discovered
- **issues.md**: Problems, blockers, gotchas encountered during work
- **problems.md**: Unresolved issues, technical debt flagged

**USE this information to:**
- Inform your next delegation (avoid known pitfalls)
- Adjust your plan if blockers were discovered
- Propagate learnings to subsequent subagents

**STEP 6: CHECK BOULDER STATE DIRECTLY (EVERY TIME - NO EXCEPTIONS)**

Do NOT rely on cached progress. Read the plan file NOW:
\`\`\`
Read(".sisyphus/plans/${planName}.md")
\`\`\`
Count exactly: how many \`- [ ]\` remain? How many \`- [x]\` completed?
This is YOUR ground truth. Use it to decide what comes next.

${commitStep}
**STEP ${nextStepNumber}: PROCEED TO NEXT TASK**

- Read the plan file AGAIN to identify the next \`- [ ]\` task
- Start immediately - DO NOT STOP

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**${remaining} tasks remain. Keep bouldering.**`

**FINAL WAVE APPROVAL GATE**

The last Final Verification Wave result just passed.
This is the ONLY point where approval-style user interaction is required.

1. Read \
\`.sisyphus/plans/${planName}.md\` again and confirm every remaining unchecked **top-level** task belongs to F1-F4.
   Ignore nested checkboxes under Acceptance Criteria, Evidence, or Final Checklist sections.
2. Consolidate the F1-F4 verdicts into a short summary for the user.
3. Tell the user all final reviewers approved.
4. Ask for explicit user approval before editing any remaining final-wave checkboxes or marking the plan complete.
5. Wait for the user's explicit approval. Do NOT auto-continue. Do NOT call \
\`task()\` again unless the user rejects and requests fixes.

If the user rejects or requests changes:
- delegate the required fix
- re-run the affected final-wave reviewer
- present the updated results again
- wait again for explicit user approval

**DO NOT mark the final-wave checkbox complete until the user explicitly says okay.**`

**STEP 5: CHECK YOUR PROGRESS DIRECTLY (EVERY TIME - NO EXCEPTIONS)**

Do NOT rely on memory or cached state. Run \`todoread\` NOW to see exact current state.
Count pending vs completed tasks. This is your ground truth for what comes next.

**STEP 6: UPDATE TODO STATUS (IMMEDIATELY)**

RIGHT NOW - Do not delay. Verification passed → Mark IMMEDIATELY.

1. Run \`todoread\` to see your todo list
2. Mark the completed task as \`completed\` using \`todowrite\`

**DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. Unmarked = Untracked = Lost progress.**

**STEP 7: EXECUTE QA TASKS (IF ANY)**

If QA tasks exist in your todo list:
- Execute them BEFORE proceeding
- Mark each QA task complete after successful verification

**STEP 8: PROCEED TO NEXT PENDING TASK**

- Run \`todoread\` AGAIN to identify the next \`pending\` task
- Start immediately - DO NOT STOP

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**NO TODO = NO TRACKING = INCOMPLETE WORK. Use todowrite aggressively.**`
