export const BACKGROUND_TASK_DESCRIPTION = `Run agent task in background. Returns task_id immediately; notifies on completion.

Use \`background_output\` to get results. Prompts MUST be in English.`

export const BACKGROUND_OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION = `Get output from background task. Use full_session=true to fetch session messages with filters. System notifies on completion, so block=true rarely needed. - Timeout values are in milliseconds (ms), NOT seconds.

IMPORTANT: ONLY call this tool AFTER receiving a <system-reminder> notification for the task. Do NOT call immediately after launching a background task - wait for the notification first.`

export const BACKGROUND_CANCEL_DESCRIPTION = `Cancel running background task(s). Use all=true to cancel ALL before final answer.`
