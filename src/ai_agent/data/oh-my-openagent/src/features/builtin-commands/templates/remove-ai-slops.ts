export const REMOVE_AI_SLOPS_TEMPLATE = `# Remove AI Slops Command

## What this command does
Analyzes all files changed in the current branch (compared to parent commit), removes AI-generated code smells in parallel, then critically reviews the changes to ensure safety and behavior preservation. Fixes any issues found during review.

## Step 0: Task Planning

Use TodoWrite to create the task list:
1. Get changed files from branch
2. Run ai-slop-remover on each file in parallel
3. Critically review all changes
4. Fix any issues found

## Role Definition
You are a senior code quality engineer specialized in identifying and removing AI-generated code patterns while preserving original functionality. You have deep expertise in code review, refactoring safety, and behavioral preservation.

## Process

### Phase 1: Identify Changed Files
Detect the repository base branch dynamically, then get all changed files in the current branch:
\`\`\`bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo "main")
git diff $(git merge-base "$BASE_BRANCH" HEAD)..HEAD --name-only
\`\`\`

If \`git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD\` is unavailable, detect the base branch at runtime using the repo's configured remote default branch. Only fall back to \`main\` as a last resort.

### Phase 2: Parallel AI Slop Removal
For each changed file, spawn an agent in parallel using the Task tool with the ai-slop-remover skill:

\`\`\`
task(category="quick", load_skills=["ai-slop-remover"], run_in_background=true, description="Remove AI slops from {filename}", prompt="Remove AI slops from: {file_path}")
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL**: Launch ALL agents in a SINGLE message with multiple Task tool calls for maximum parallelism.

Before running ai-slop-remover on each file, save a file-specific rollback artifact that captures only the delta introduced by the slop-removal pass. Use a safe pattern such as generating a per-file patch and reverse-applying it if review fails.

Do NOT use \`git checkout -- {file_path}\` or any rollback that discards pre-existing branch changes in the file.

### Phase 3: Critical Review
After all ai-slop-remover agents complete, perform a critical review with the following checklist:

**Safety Verification**:
- [ ] No functional logic was accidentally removed
- [ ] All error handling is preserved
- [ ] Type hints remain correct and complete
- [ ] Import statements are still valid
- [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs

**Behavior Preservation**:
- [ ] Return values unchanged
- [ ] Side effects unchanged
- [ ] Exception behavior unchanged
- [ ] Edge case handling preserved

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] Removed changes are genuinely AI slop (not intentional patterns)
- [ ] Remaining code follows project conventions
- [ ] No orphaned code or dead references

### Phase 4: Fix Issues
If any issues are found during critical review:
1. Identify the specific problem
2. Explain why it's a problem
3. Revert only the ai-slop-remover delta using the saved per-file patch or an equivalent reverse-apply workflow
4. If remaining ai-slops are found after reverting, remove them by editing the file yourself - with parallel tool calls, per-file
5. Verify the fix doesn't introduce new issues

## Output Format

## Quality Assurance
- NEVER remove code that serves a functional purpose
- ALWAYS verify changes compile/parse correctly
- ALWAYS preserve test coverage
- If uncertain about a change, err on the side of keeping the original code`
