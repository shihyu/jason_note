# Stock Analysis Workflow

An automated stock analysis system that helps you collect data, assess risks, and generate trading reports.

📖 **中文文檔**: [README.md](./README.md)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Full Analysis on a Single Stock
Use this when you want to conduct in-depth research on a stock:
```
/full-analysis [TICKER]
```
**Example**: `/full-analysis RCAT`
- Automatically collects real-time quotes, financial reports, institutional holdings
- Checks catalysts (PDUFA, earnings dates, contracts)
- Calculates risk score
- Provides entry/exit recommendations
- Auto-generates individual reports and updates summary

### 2. Short-term Scan
Use this when looking for potential trading opportunities:
```
/stock-scan
```
- Scans today's hot stocks, top gainers, unusual options activity
- Automatically filters out low-quality targets
- Generates a "Short-term Screening" report

### 3. Generate Summary Report
When you've analyzed multiple stocks and want to see aggregated results:
```
/summary
```
- Reads all Session data
- Compares priority and risk/reward ratios across all targets
- Creates a catalyst timeline
- Outputs final trading decision recommendations

---

## 📂 File Structure

All analysis results are automatically saved in the `sessions/` folder:

- `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-[TICKER]-full-analysis.md`: Detailed report for a single stock
- `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-full-analysis-summary.md`: Summary of all stocks in the session
- `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md`: Final decision guide (generated by `/summary`)

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Commands

If you only want to execute a specific part of the analysis, use these commands:

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/stock-data` | Collect basic data (price/market cap/volume) | `/stock-data PLTR` |
| `/catalyst-check` | Check catalysts (earnings/FDA/contracts) | `/catalyst-check RGNX` |
| `/risk-score` | Calculate risk score only | `/risk-score TSLA` |
| `/entry-exit` | Technical entry/exit analysis only | `/entry-exit NVDA` |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Daily Workflow**:
    - Run `/stock-scan` first for ideas
    - Select 3-5 interesting targets
    - Run `/full-analysis` on each target
    - Finally run `/summary` to create a daily report

2. **Key Focus Areas**:
    - **PDUFA/Earnings**: Use `/catalyst-check` to ensure accurate dates. Binary event risks are high for biotech.
    - **Risk Score**: 80+ is "High Priority", 60-80 is "Medium Priority", below 60 suggests watching.

3. **Data Verification**:
    - The system tries to fetch real-time data, but verify during market hours for current volatility.

## 🔧 IDE Workflow Setup

This system's workflows can be used in AI Agent-enabled IDEs. Below are setup instructions for each IDE:

### Antigravity (Google)

**Directory Structure**:
```
your-project/
└── .agent/
    └── workflows/
        ├── stock-data.md
        ├── catalyst-check.md
        ├── risk-score.md
        └── ...
```

**File Format**:
```yaml
---
description: Brief description of the workflow
---

# Workflow Title

Detailed execution steps...
```

**Special Annotations**:
- `// turbo` - Place above a step to allow auto-execution (no user confirmation needed)
- `// turbo-all` - Place anywhere in the file to allow all steps to auto-execute

**Usage**: Type `/workflow-name [parameters]` in the chat window

---

### Cursor

**Directory Structure**:
```
your-project/
└── .cursor/
    └── rules/
        ├── stock-data.mdc
        ├── catalyst-check.mdc
        └── ...
```

**File Format** (`.mdc`):
```yaml
---
description: Workflow description
globs: 
alwaysApply: false
---

# Workflow Title

Detailed execution steps...
```

**Notes**:
- File extension must be `.mdc` (Markdown Cursor)
- `globs` can specify applicable file types
- `alwaysApply: true` makes the rule apply automatically

**Usage**: Type `/workflow-name [parameters]` in chat or reference via `@rules`

---

### Windsurf

**Directory Structure**:
```
your-project/
└── .windsurf/
    └── workflows/
        ├── stock-data.md
        ├── catalyst-check.md
        └── ...
```

**File Format**:
```yaml
---
trigger: manual
description: Workflow description
---

# Workflow Title

Detailed execution steps...
```

**Trigger Modes** (`trigger`):
- `manual` - Manual trigger
- `always` - Always apply
- `glob` - Trigger when file matches conditions (requires `globs` field)

**Usage**: Type `/workflow-name [parameters]` in the chat window

### Workflow Conversion Guide

To convert this project's workflows to other IDEs:

| Source (Antigravity) | Target IDE | Required Changes |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| `.agent/workflows/*.md` | Cursor | Copy to `.cursor/rules/`, change extension to `.mdc` |
| `.agent/workflows/*.md` | Windsurf | Copy to `.windsurf/workflows/`, add `trigger: manual` |
| `// turbo` annotation | Cursor/Windsurf | Remove (these IDEs don't support this annotation) |

---

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature | Antigravity | Cursor | Windsurf |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Workflow Directory | `.agent/workflows/` | `.cursor/rules/` | `.windsurf/workflows/` |
| File Extension | `.md` | `.mdc` | `.md` |
| Auto-run Annotation | `// turbo` | Not supported | Not supported |
| Trigger Modes | N/A | `globs`, `alwaysApply` | `trigger: manual/always/glob` |
| Frontmatter | `description` | `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply` | `trigger`, `description` |
