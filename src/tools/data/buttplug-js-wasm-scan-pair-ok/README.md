# Buttplug JS and WASM

This repo includes 2 projects:

- buttplug-js: A pure Typescript/Javascript implementation of a Buttplug Client. This can be used to
  connect to Buttplug Servers like [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central) or the Buttplug WASM Server
- buttplug-wasm: A WASM compilation of the Rust implementation of the Buttplug Server, with a
  WebBluetooth device communication manager. This will allow connection to hardware in browsers that have WebBluetooth connectivity (Chromium/Blink based browsers like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, etc...)

See the README in each of the project directories for more info on the projects.
