# gcc-ubuntu-docker
Versions of gcc running on ubuntu

The goal is to have images for all version of GCC >= 4.4 running on the current LTS of ubuntu. Currently running against the LTS that was current when the version was released.

Update 2021-10-02 - Because of lack of support for 12.04, only GCC >= 4.6 will have new builds going forward.
